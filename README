A Bittorrent client written in JavaScript on top of node.js

SummerTorrent is intended to be a full-fledged command-line-based client, similar
to http://github.com/jackpal/Taipei-Torrent.

This is in contrast to http://github.com/WizKid/node-bittorrent ,
which is currently more of a bitTorrent seeder than a full bitTorrent client.

*Caution: SummerTorrent doesn't actually work yet.*

Implemented features:
+ Parse .torrent files.
+ Scan disk to compute good/bad pieces for data files.
+ Request peer list from tracker to request.

TODO:
- UPNP open a port for listening for peers.
- Handle redirects from trackers.
- Create directories for multi-file torrents.
- Listen for peers.
- Parse tracker response.
- Connect to peers.
- Exchange data with peers.
